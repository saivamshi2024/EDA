# EDA
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
---
1- Variable Identification 

	independent variable
	dependent variable 
	relavant attribute
	ir-relavant attribute 

when ever you build any ml project every time try to build model with revant attributeonly 

Never ever build ml model with irrelaveat attribute or else 
MULTICOLLINEARITY OR OVERFITTING problem will happen 


2- univariate analysis - plot the graph using 1 variable is called 


3- BIvariate anlaysis -- plot the graph using 2 variable 

corelation -- The relation between 2 variable is called corelation 
	range of the corelation is -1 to 1 

positive corelation -- range (0 - 1)
negative corelation -- (-1 to 0)
no corelation - range -- 0

If in the dataset all the columne are relavnet then only you will get +Ve corelation 
happily you can build ml model 

We see the graphs for regression & classification 

corelation - relation between 2 varaibel ( sft - price, studen reading - writing) 
regress - dv is continuous
classifcation - dv is binary 

4- OUTLIER Detection 
	datapoint which is very far from other observation 

How to detect outlier -- graph, inter quartile range, z-score


5- missing value treatment  ( how to handle missing value)

dataset (excelsheet) - missing value 

number (Numerical data) - in the dataset if numerical data will missing 
text (categorical data) -- in the dataset if categorical data will missing 

MISSING NUMERICAL DATA 
	mean staretegy 
	median strategy 
	mode strategy 
	
MISSING CATEGORICAL DATA 
	mode strategy 
	nearest neighbour  (k =1 ) 
	
7- VARIABLE CREATION  - new variable will create using transformer or imputation 

6th --> variable imputaion 

imputation technique also called as TRANSFORMER 
convert categorical data to numerical data is called imputeration techniq

Dummy variable 
Labelencoder 
One hot encoder 

EDA TRANSFORMER
ML TRANSFORMER
NLP TRANSFORMER
DL TRANSFORMER
GENERATIVE AI TRANSFORMER
